### How website is organized
I organized each web page into three parts: the intro in which the student introduces themself, 
their internships and work experience, and their courses that they are taking or have already taken.

### Ontology
All of the webpages listed are for U of R students who all have some interest in computer science.
Classes: U of R students 
Relationships: all are currently taking CSC 174 and are classmates

### Taxonomy
Each webpage is divided into 3 terms: Intro, which has a general description of the student's background and interests,
Internships and Work Experience, which discusses the student's experiences with internships and other jobs, and Courses, which
discusses notable courses that the student has taken or is currently taking and their experiences in those courses. At the top of each webpage is a portrait of the student with their majors/interests listed.

### Choreography
Each webpage is set up like a casual resume. I decided to put information that would be considered the "intro" first - such as where they live, what year they are in, their major, etc. Next, I decided to put data that describes any internships or work experiences they have that are relevant to their interests. Last, I used the section where the students discuss their relevant courses.
