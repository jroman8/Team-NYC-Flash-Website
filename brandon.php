        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p> First-generation student studying Financial Economics and Computer Science at the University of Rochester.Through a growing list of diverse experiences, I've developed a unique skill set in financial strategy, marketing, programming, information technology, and graphic design that will allow me to bridge the gap 
         between developers and analysts. </p>    

        <p>I am from a city close to Rochester, New York. Rochester is a city on Lake Ontario, in New York State. Old industrial buildings cluster near the Genesee River’s High Falls. A vast collection of toys and dolls forms the core of the Strong National Museum of Play. The George Eastman Museum, on the early-1900s estate of the Kodak founder, has photography exhibits, film archives and gardens. Rochester Museum & Science Center has hands-on displays and a planetarium. New York is a state in the northeastern U.S., known for New York City and towering Niagara Falls. NYC’s island of Manhattan is home to the Empire State Building, Times Square and Central Park. The Brooklyn Bridge connects Manhattan with the borough of Brooklyn. The iconic Statue of Liberty stands in New York Harbor. To the east, Long Island has beaches, the Montauk Lighthouse, the ritzy Hamptons and Fire Island.</p>

        <h2>Internships and Work Experience</h2>
        <p> Financial Strategy: Managed the five year financial model for Artemis, an e-commerce jewelry company whose core mission is to empower refugees through education by redirecting their social entrepreneurial efforts at aiding Tibetan refugees. Turned the company profitable one year faster than previously projected and increased the amount of refugees aided by nearly 10% </p>

        <p> Technology and Computer Science: At the Simon Business School, I help offices in their transition to utilizing more technology based tools to make operations more efficient and I am a direct source of instant technological support. Common tasks include: data mining using excel, advising Simon students, faculty and staff on technology, and occasionally business, related issues, and light web development for club websites. Created a MIPs emulator in C, GPS of New York State in Java, and a Presidential pong app in Java. I also created a website for Veteran's R. US., a charitable project made by students at the Simon Business School aimed at providing employment resources for US veterans.  As one of the graphic designers at the Simon Business School, I managed and created all club posters. Most notable recognition coming from Carla Harris - Vice Chairman, Wealth Management, Managing Director and Senior Client Adviser at Morgan Stanley. I've also created and managed a YouTube brand that grossed over 1.4 million views, which I later turned into a company that created videos and logos for other top YouTube brands, one of which was the number one YouTube channel in it's category. </p>

        <h2>Courses</h2>
